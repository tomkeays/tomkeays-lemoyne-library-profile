# Tom Keays Library Profile

This is the end of the line for my [LibGuides profile](https://resources.library.lemoyne.edu/profiles/tomkeays) at Le Moyne College. I already removed it from the main library repo, but thought I'd preserve it here in its final form. The last version of these files, including the previous commit history can be found at:

- https://github.com/lemoynelibrary/lemoyne/commit/db55029fb75071468b2419ec04d016cea914ce49

Since my final day will be August 25, 2022, it seemed right to do one last version.
