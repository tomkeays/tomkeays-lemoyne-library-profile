<h3 style="margin: 0 0 1em 0">Library Systems Consultant</h3>

<p><strong>Contact Me</strong>: I am officially retired as the subject librarian for <a href="https://resources.library.lemoyne.edu/subjects/computer-science">Computer Science</a>, <a href="https://resources.library.lemoyne.edu/subjects/information-systems">Information Systems</a>, and <a href="https://resources.library.lemoyne.edu/subjects/mathematics">Mathematics</a>. Please contact <a href="https://resources.library.lemoyne.edu/prf.php?account_id=324388">Pauline Shostack</a> if you need help in those or any subject areas.</p>

<p>I may continue to work for the library as a consultant to support library systems. You can reach me by <a href="mailto:keaysht@lemoyne.edu" target="_blank" title="Email me at keaysht@lemoyne.edu">email</a> and I&#39;ll try to reply by the next working day. I am still available to meet by Zoom, but I am no longer maintaining an appointment calendar with the library. Email me and we can set something up.</p>
